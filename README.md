# COMP.4630 - Semester Project: Student Resources Forum App
Authors: Caroline Demasi, Brandon Zuniga

This project is a semester long project with the goal of creating a mobile application designed
to be a resource for students in a university setting.

This program will:
1. Provide a social media/forum space for students to learn, ask questions, get resources, and
interact with other students in a similar setting.
2. Close the gaps where existing apps fail to seal (Quizlet, Brainly, StuDocu)
3. Provide an understanding of the methodology of building a mobile application.

Notes:
* The program was built and ran in Android Studio.
* The program was tested on a Google Pixel 2XL running the latest version of Android 11.
