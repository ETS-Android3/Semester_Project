# COMP.4630 - Semester Project: Student Resources Forum App
Authors: Caroline DeMasi, Brandon Zuniga

This project is a semester long project with the goal of creating a mobile application designed
to be a resource for students in a university setting.

Notes:
* The program was built and ran in Android Studio.
* The program was tested on a Google Pixel 2XL running the latest version of Android 11.


## Short Report

This program will:
1. Provide a social media/forum space for students to learn, ask questions, get resources, and
   interact with other students in a similar setting.
2. Close the gaps where existing apps fail to seal (Quizlet, Brainly, StuDocu).
   We chose this approach due to the fact that many students already have social media apps,
   and having one that is designed to help students in college would be beneficial.
3. Provide an understanding of the methodology of building a mobile application.

## Installation
1. Navigate to release[release](FIXME . com) folder to download the apk to android device and open apk to install and run our app.
